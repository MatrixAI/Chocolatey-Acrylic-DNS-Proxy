    <description>### Overview
Acrylic is a local DNS proxy for Windows which improves the performance of your computer by caching the responses coming from your DNS servers and helps you fight unwanted ads through a custom HOSTS file (optimized for handling hundreds of thousands of domain names) with support for wildcards and regular expressions.

This package will install Acrylic DNS Proxy into Program Files (x86), it will also add a Windows service called `Acrylic DNS Proxy` which will be automatically started and set to start on startup. The service will not run if you already have something bound to port 53 UDP on IPv4 or IPv6.

It also automatically creates an Inbound Firewall Rule called `Allow Acrylic DNS Proxy Service`, it is enabled on all interfaces, allowing any packet to hit `AcrylicService.exe`. The service itself however is configured to limit its responses to local IPs, this is configurable.

The 2 executables to play with are `AcrylicController.exe` and `AcrylicConsole.exe`. The controller controls the service, while the console is an interactive foreground version of the service.

All configuration occurs inside the installation folder.

Uninstallation is not automated at the moment. To uninstall, navigate to installation directory and run `Uninstall.exe /S`.
